# Civic Tech DC — AI Working Group

## Purpose

Kick off an ongoing AI working group. Align on intent, surface opportunities/risks, and pick **1–2 tiny, high‑impact pilots** to run before the next meeting.

## Desired outcomes (by minute 30\)

* Shared **principles & guardrails** for AI pilots  
* Shortlist of **3–5 candidate automations** across Board/Operations/Incubator/Projects  
* **Select 1–2 pilots**, each with an owner, buddy, and success metric  
* Date/time for **next check‑in**

## Norms

* **MVP then scale**: ship small, learn fast  
* **Open \+ ethical**: privacy, bias, accessibility matter  
* **One mic, many voices**: stack in chat; be concise  
* **Timeboxes win**: done \> perfect; use parking lot

## Pilot card

* **Name:**  
* **Hypothesis (1 sentence):** When we \_\_\_, we expect \_\_\_ for \_\_\_.  
* **Users served / stakeholders:**  
* **Inputs / data sources:** (links; permissions)  
* **Output / handoff:** (what, where)  
* **Success metric (one):** e.g., hours saved/month, response time ↓, adoption %  
* **Risks & guardrails:** privacy/PII, false positives, bias, accessibility, human‑in‑the‑loop  
* **Owner \+ Buddy:**  
* **Timeline:** start / demo date / kill‑switch criteria

## Guardrail checklist

* Data permissions verified; **no unauthorized PII**  
* Documented prompts/config in repo; **reproducible**  
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop** for consequential actions  
* **Bias/accessibility** spot‑checks; inclusive language  
* **Observability**: simple log of inputs/outputs & issues  
* Clear **opt‑out** and **kill‑switch**

## Fast candidate menu

* Board: meetings → **minutes & action items**; **filings/compliance** reminders  
* Operations: **event cross‑posting**, RSVP insights, **volunteer matching**; inbox triage  
* Incubator: problem‑intake **clustering**, mentor matching, **progress dashboards**  
* Projects: **data cleaning**, **comment analysis**, GitHub **issue triage**, docs generation

## Tools setup (suggested)

* Video: Zoom/Meet (enable chat \+ reactions)  
* Shared notes: Google Doc (this doc)  
* Voting: chat codes (H/M/L) or lightweight poll  
* Timer: visible countdown  
* Parking lot: section at bottom of notes  
* Team Communications: Slack  
* Documentation/Code Storage: Github
